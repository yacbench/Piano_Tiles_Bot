I- Setting up your Virtual Environment:

I highly recomand creating your own venv before using the code, to do so, all you need to do is to execute the following command in your CMD.
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment

II- Activating the "environement": 
Use the following command: environment\Scripts\activate

III- Install the "requirements.txt" file containing the used packages in this project:
Use the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Great! Now you are all set to start playing with the code
Have Fun !
