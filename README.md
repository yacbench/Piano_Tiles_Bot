## Getting Started
To start using the `piano-tiles.py` script we need to first do some sutups.

## Setting up your Virtual Environment:

I highly recomand creating your own venv before using the code, to do so, all you need to do is to execute the following command in your CMD.
```
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```
***Ps:** Remember to change the path to your actuall wanted distination folder.*

## Activating the environement 
The activation of the virtual environement is done using the following command: 
```
environment\Scripts\activate
```

## Install the packages used in this project
To do so, use the following command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Great! Now you are all set to start playing with the code.**

***Have Fun !***
